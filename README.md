## Dependencies

The QuickSight data depends heavily on other scripts and processes to gather and prepare data.
A full documentation of dependencies should guarantee maintainability and stability.

### Tables
- public data
    - `cryptostruct.instruments`
    - `cryptostruct.fx_minute`
    - `cryptostruct.fx_daily`
- privata data
    - `account.current`
    - `account.history`
    - `account.transfer`
    - `alpha.trades`
- private data from CryptoStruct Backend
    - `positions__underlyings` (implemented in core repo)

#### Process
- `monkey-bi`
    - InstrumentImport
    - SyncFx daily
    - TradeImport
- `alpha-ui`
    - Account Sync

## Daily
- Exposure
    - from CryptoStruct Backends `positions__underlyings` with `cryptostruct.fx_daily`
    - Transfers from `account.transfer`
    - TPL60 / Turnover from `alpha.trades`

## Intraday
- Trade Data from `alpha.trades`
- Exposure from CryptoStruct Backends `positions__underlyings` with `cryptostruct.fx_minute`
- All other views are `MATERIALIZED VIEWS` that are generated on this base data
  - `_avg7d` only needs to be generated once a day
  - `intraday_top_instruments` view is only based on the `alpha.trades` table

## Setup
### Access
- QuickSight is setup in AWS Dublin (Old QuickSight Version in London)
    - https://eu-west-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com
    - `alpha-rock`

### Datasets
- All Datasets refer to a table or view with the same name in the Postgres cluster
- All Datasets are setup in a Shared Folder
    - `Lukas MÃ¤rkl` and `Marco Scholz` have Owner permission to the Datasets

### Postgres Cluster
- Cluster URL: `quant.cluster-cm3hezyaasbb.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com`
    - No issue with changing IPs !!!
- QuickSight has a separate Usernames for the PostgresCluster
    - `quicksight_admin` to generate data within the `quicksight`schema
    - `quicksight_connect` to only read data
    - Separate users allow to better control permissions and usage
